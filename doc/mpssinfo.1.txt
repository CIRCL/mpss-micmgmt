MPSSINFO(1)
============


NAME
----

mpssinfo - Provide information about current Intel(R) Xeon Phi(TM) coprocessor
hardware and driver.


SYNOPSIS
--------

*mpssinfo* ['OPTIONS']

////
This is a comment block, and will not appear in the generated man pages.
This is an asciiDoc formatted file, used to create manpage entries for micinfo.
In order for a2x to correctly convert this file into man-page format, there can not be
anything other than:

TITLE
NAME
SYNOPSIS

as the first three sections of this file.  (That's why the comments have been placed
here.)

In order to convert this file into man-page format (ie. a file that can be read by 'man')
run the following command:

a2x --doctype manpage --format manpage <fileName>
where <fileName> is the name of this file (it should be mpssinfo.1.txt).
////

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The *mpssinfo* command displays information about the Intel(R) Xeon Phi(TM)
coprocessors installed on the system along with relevant details about the
Coprocessor OS and the driver.

NOTE: Certain device information will be unavailable when running 
*mpssinfo* as a non-root user.


OPTIONS
-------

*-h*, *--help* [=[device|list|version]]::
  Display command help.

*-l*, *--list*::
  List all Intel(R) Xeon Phi(TM) coprocessors detected.

*-d* '<deviceNum>', *--device*='<deviceNum>' [-g '<groupname>'|--group='<groupname>'] ::
  Displays information about the user-specified MIC device (determined by 
  '<deviceNum>').  To display information about all the available coprocessors, 
  'all' may be specified in place of the coprocessor device number.  The user 
  may additionally specify the type of information with the *--group* option.

*-g* '<groupname>', *--group*='<groupname>' ::
  Allows printing only a subset of the coprocessor information.  If the *--group* 
  option is not given, all groups are displayed.  Note: if no coprocessor device 
  number is specified, it will display the requested group information for all the 
  available coprocessors.

  Valid values for '<groupname>' are: :::
    'version' :::: Show Flash and Coprocessor OS versions. Show SMC boot loader version 
                (SMC versions 1.9 and later). For earlier SMC versions, the 
                SMC boot loader version is reported as "Not Available".
    'board'    :::: Show Intel(R) Xeon Phi(TM) coprocessor related information
    'core'     :::: Show number of cores, voltage and frequency
    'thermal'  :::: Show fan and thermal related data
    'gddr'     :::: Show coprocessor memory related information
    'all'      :::: Show all groups (default when group option is not specified)

  :: All groups for all devices are displayed if *mpssinfo(1)* is run without 
     any arguments.

*--version*
  Display the tool version.

Prefixes are accepted for options and group names.  For example, the following
commands are valid:

[verse]
mpssinfo --dev 0
mpssinfo --dev 0 --group ver

EXAMPLES
--------

// Anything between matching ==== will be included in the man page output as an example.
// The man page generator auto-labels (and cross-references) all of the examples.

.Listing Devices
=======

The following will print all Intel(R) Xeon Phi(TM) coprocessors detected on the 
system, providing the device ID, PCI bus number, PCI device number and 
hardware ID of each coprocessor.  

Below is example output taken from a system with two coprocessors installed:
//The code below will show in the man page exactly how it is seen here
